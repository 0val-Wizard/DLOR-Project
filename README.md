# DLOR-Project
Deep Learning and Object Recognition (DLOR) it introduces students to the fundamental principles of deep learning and how it is applied to a collection of computer vision tasks to implement object recognition. It covers the concepts and architecture of convolutional neural networks such as the various layers within, and the hyperparameters involved
